# Insights â€” 2025 Dataset

## Successes
- High engagement with prompts related to **AI in healthcare** and **sustainable practices**.
- Clearer definitions in prompts resulted in more targeted and actionable responses.
- Sector-specific prompts (e.g., blockchain in food traceability) yielded high-quality outputs.

## Failures
- Overly broad prompts still returned generic results even after refinement.
- Some emerging tech topics (e.g., quantum AI) lacked sufficient public domain data in 2025.
- Few prompts required multiple iterations before reaching the desired specificity.

## Prompting Tips
- Always define the **time frame** explicitly for temporal relevance.
- Include **target audience or domain** to focus the output.
- Use **verbs** that imply analysis or evaluation rather than vague exploration.

## Patterns Noticed
- **Generative AI** remains a dominant theme across industries.
- Climate and sustainability topics are interlinked with economic and trade discussions.
- Ethical and privacy concerns are increasingly common in tech-related prompts.
